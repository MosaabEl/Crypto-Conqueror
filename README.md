# Crypto-Conqueror



This is a fairly simple application to start. All that needs to be done is to enter into terminal inside the FinalProjectCS directiory:

export FLASK_APP=bot.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run

The host server link will then be provided which you can instantiate to open to the log in page,
otherwise you enter through: http://127.0.0.1:5000/   

The login username and surname is both admin for guests.
